The inclusion of P[LA] competed with the attractive van der Waals forces between MWCNTs altering interfacial interactions between neighbouring CNTs and, assisted their dispersion and distribution in a poly(propylene) ( PP) matrix, confirmed from SEM / HR- TEM imaging and oscillatory rheology measurements. A rheological percolation threshold measured for composites of unmodified MWCNTs and PP at ~0.5 wt % was shifted to lower MWCNT concentrations ( ~0.25 wt %) for P[LA] functionalised MWCNTs. Addition of P[LA] also reduced the nucleating effect of MWCNTs for PP as a coating of P[LA] on the nanotube surfaces hindered trans- crystallisation of the PP. Evidence from static and dynamic mechanical measurements confirmed the P[LA] plasticised PP as both an increase in ductility and a decrease in the glass transition temperature ( T_{g}) of PP of up to 25 ° C was obtained. Addition of unmodified MWCNTs to PP resulted in an increase in the DC electrical conductivity of PP of 15 orders of magnitude, from 10^{-14} S / m to 10^{1} S / m for a MWCNT loading of 5 wt %.

The carbon membranes made after preoxidation at 480 ° C and heat treatment at 650 ° C have an oxygen permeability of 131.5 Barrer and an ideal O_{2}/N_{2} selectivity of 9.7. The incorporation of ZSM-5 into the carbon membranes further helps to improve the separation performance of the carbon / zeolite membranes for H_{2}/N_{2} gas mixture."

Micro- fluorescence spectra provide strong support for the notion that thermal annealing can reduce the free volume and promote the formation of charge transfer complexes. As a consequence, the improved rigidity of the polymer chains increases the polymer discrimination of shape and size for penetrants, although no chemical reaction occurs with thermal annealing."

7,POLYMER_FAMILY,polyp,951,956,"The well- defined anionic polymerization of ( E)-1,3-pentadiene ( EP) using various RLi initiators in nonpolar solvent was studied. The results of the polymerization kinetics with n- BuLi initiator in cyclohexane confirmed the expected living nature of the anionic polymerization of EP. An apparent activation energy of 86.17 ± 2.93 kJ / mol has been achieved for the poorly reactive EP polymerization, while an apparent activation energy close to 80 kJ / mol has been gained for the polymerization of IP under the same conditions. The obtained homopolymer with predictable molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions ( 1.05 < = D < = 1.19) was completely characterized by GPC, DSC,^{1}H NMR and quantitative^{13}C NMR. It was found that the trans-1,4 structure is predominant in the amorphous polymer and the portion of 1,2-structure is relatively fixed.

8,POLYMER,poly ( vinylidene fluoride ),198,223,"A novel rigid fluorescent probe, carbazole- terephthalate cyclophane ( Cz- TP) was applied to evaluate local dielectric constants ( ε) of various polymer solids in a wide range of temperatures. For poly(vinylidene fluoride), the ε increased above the glass transition temperature ( T_{g}), due to relaxations of the polar segment -(CH_{2}CF_{2})- of the main chain. For poly(alkyl methacrylate)s, the ε increased above the T_{g} or the melting temperature of the side chain, where motions of the polar ester groups are activated. For cyanoethylated polymers, the ε increased owing to motions of the polar cyano groups at the end of the side chain and the ε corresponded to the dielectric constant evaluated by dielectric relaxation measurement at a high frequency, because the Cz- TP exciplex has a lifetime of tens of nanoseconds. For a cyanoethylated polymer with a high content of cyano groups, the ε was larger at low temperatures than the dielectric constant obtained by the macroscopic dielectric relaxation measurement. These results show that the Cz- TP molecule is a useful probe for evaluation of the local polarity in polymer solids over a wide temperature range and can detect even a small change in ε at transition temperatures such as glass transition, side- chain melting, and side- chain relaxation."

Excellent thermal stability was observed due to the presence of a rigid tetraphenylsilane- based polymer backbone ( T_{g} = 218 ° C, T_{d} = 373 ° C). In solution, PTOA shows photoluminescence ( PL) with an emission maximum at 426 nm, which is attributed to the light- emitting unit of the triarylaminooxadiazole group. In solid film, the emission maximum of PL is observed at 458 nm, a 32 nm red- shift from the PL in solution. The solvatochromic effect and excimer formed in the solid film are responsible for the red- shifting and broadening of the PL emission band. The PL stability and morphology of the PTOA solid film were further investigated by thermal annealing at elevated temperatures. No significant difference in the PL spectra or morphology was observed between a pristine sample and a repeatedly thermally annealed film ( at 200 ° C). PTOA- based PLED shows EL with a main peak at 458 nm accompanied by a shoulder at around 530 nm. The light emission from electromer or electroplex leads to a broadening of the EL spectra ( 400- 650 nm), which corresponds to the interaction between the oxadiazole and diphenyl(4-tolyl)amine groups in different polymer segments or chains. A sky blue emission ( Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage ( CIE_{x},y) coordinates ( 0.20,0.23)) was obtained for PTOA- based PLED.

These porous membranes can simply be prepared from a phase separation process induced by water vapor. In this work, the influence of the material properties of poly(2,5-benzimidazole) ( ABPBI) on the membrane structure formation and ion transport characteristics is systematically investigated. Two batches of ABPBI polymers ( intrinsic viscosity 2.0 and 1.4 dL g-1) are used; concentrations of polymer solution, the water vapor activity ( temperature and relative humidity), and the exposure time of polymer solution to the water vapor are varied. It is found that high viscosity of ABPBI solution, among other factors, is essential in obtaining membranes with very low interconnectivity between macropores in the membrane bulk, therefore very low vanadium ion permeability suitable for VRFB applications. The porous ABPBI membranes in dry state have a low amount of pores ranging from 1 to ~ 200 nm. Due to the benzimidazole moieties in ABPBI polymers, the acid in vanadium electrolytes has two positive effects on ABPBI membranes: fixed positive charges, and absorption of acid in the membranes. The ion exchange capacity of ABPBI membranes increases with the increase in solution acid concentration, and reaches striking values as high as 8 mequ g-1 in 4.0 M H_{2}SO_{4}.

To our surprise, sPBI membranes show an anomalous water uptake and swelling behavior, which exhibits a decreasing tendency with temperature. This is considered to be due to the secondary relaxation of sPBI at about 60 ° C. In addition, sPBI membranes indicate excellent oxidative stability and low proton conductivity. The TEM investigation demonstrates that the hydrophilic ionic channels of sPBI become bigger and bigger as the sulfonation degree rises, leading to the result that the water uptake and proton conductivity enhance with increasing sulfonation degree. The sPBI membranes are a candidate material for proton exchange membranes."

In the case of phenosafranin, the produced nanotubes were considerably thicker and were always accompanied by globules. Upon oxidation both dyes are expected to generate insoluble oligomeric templates that serve as loci for the deposition of polypyrrole. The formation of globular morphology takes place when the dye becomes depleted, due to its low concentration for safranin, or because of robust templates produced by phenosafranin. In addition to scanning and transmission electron microscopies, the resultant polypyrroles were characterized by FTIR and Raman spectroscopies, and DC conductivity measurements.

Consequently, the obtained PI films exhibit ultra low CTE ( 1.9 ppm / K) at the range of 40^{o}C-400 ° C, along with high Tg ( > 450 ° C) exhibiting great potential for flexible- display substrates."

Extents of membrane aging were evaluated through changes in gas permeability over time; the separation of gas mixtures comprising carbon dioxide and methane, which are of great interest for industrial applications such as the production of biogas or the purification of natural gas, was carried out. 50:50 vol % CO_{2}/CH_{4} mixtures were used as feed and separation performance analysed for fresh membranes and at intervals of approximately a month up to 155 days. At the end of this testing period, aged PIM-1 membranes showed a CO_{2} permeability of ( 2.0 ± 0.7) x 10^{3} Barrer, which corresponds to a CO_{2} permeability reduction of 68 % from the value obtained right after their fabrication. The addition of alkyl- functionalized GO is shown to be an efficient strategy to retard the physical aging of PIM-1 membranes; filler loadings as low as 0.05 wt % of reduced octyl- functionalized GO showed a CO_{2} permeability of ( 3.5 ± 0.6) x 10^{3} Barrer after 5 months, which is almost three quarters higher than that of pure PIM-1 membrane aged for the same time period and represents a reduction of just 39 % from its initial value.

Specifically, a series of poly(styrene- co-(glycidyl methacrylate)-co-(maleic anhydride)) ternary copolymers ( SGM) containing both reactive epoxide groups and maleic anhydride groups were synthesized and then incorporated into the immiscible poly(amide 11)/poly(l- lactic acid) ( PA11 / PLLA) blend. The terminal amino groups of PA11 are ready to react with the maleic anhydride groups of the SGM while the carboxyl groups of PLLA react with the epoxide groups of SGM.
