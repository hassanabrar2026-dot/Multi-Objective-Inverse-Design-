0,POLYMER,low density polyethylene,40,64,"A method for large- scale processing of low density polyethylene ( LDPE) nanofibers reinforced by aligned multi- walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs) is achieved via nanolayer coextrusion. The morphology and nano- sized diameter of the nanofibers are observed on scanning electron microscope. The prioritized alignment and dispersion of MWCNTs along the fiber axis are determined by transmission electron microscopy, polarized Raman spectra, and high resolution optical microscopy. The dispersion of MWCNTs in nanofibers is better than that in homologous micron- fibers. In addition, MWCNTs can promote the crystallization of LDPE in varying degrees which depend on the fiber diameter and MWCNTs content. As a result of the alignment of MWCNTs, the nanofibers exhibit enhanced mechanical properties. The tensile strength of LDPE(1 wt % MWCNTs) nanofibers is more than twice of pure nanofibers ( without MWCNTs). The volume resistivity of the LDPE(MWCNTs) nanofiber mats containing 9 wt % MWCNTs can be reduced to 100 Ω cm."

The factors controlling fouling, ranging from surface chemistry to topographic roughness, have been extensively investigated. However, the role of surface patterns, particularly at a submicron scale, on membrane fouling remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that submicron patterns can be successfully imprinted onto a commercial polysulfone ultrafiltration membrane surface using nanoimprint lithography ( NIL) without sacrificing its permeability properties. The presence of these patterns led to significantly improved deposition resistance during filtration of colloidal silica particle suspensions, as evidenced by a 19- 45 % increase in the apparent critical flux, with the magnitude dependent on particle size. Post- filtration visualization reveals an intriguing anisotropy in the particle deposition, whereby the degree of anisotropy depends on the orientation angle between the surface pattern and the flow direction of the feed. These results suggest a chemical- free route to post- formation, membrane surface modification."

Mechanical properties, transmission electron microscopy ( TEM), wide- angle X- ray diffraction ( WAXD), percentage crystallinity and isothermal thermo- gravimetric analysis ( TGA) data are reported. A particle analysis was performed to quantitatively characterize the morphology; these results are later employed in modeling the modulus of these materials using composite theory. No significant difference was observed in the mechanical properties and morphology of PA-6 nanocomposites processed at two different temperatures. PA-6 nanocomposites had superior mechanical properties than those made from PA-66. The tensile strength of PA-66 nanocomposites deviated from linearity at high levels of MMT. WAXD and TEM results show that the PA-6 nanocomposites are better exfoliated than the PA-66 nanocomposites, which exhibit a mixture of intercalated and exfoliated structures. Mechanical properties were consistent with the morphology. DSC reveals a higher percentage of crystallinity in the PA-66 samples. Isothermal TGA shows only a 5 % difference in the degradation of the organic modifier on the organoclay processed at 240 ° C versus 270 ° C.

The chemical interactions between the polymer and ionic liquid modified silica ( ILMS) were confirmed by FTIR, NMR and WAXD studies. TEM images disclosed how these interactions led to the formation of self- assembled clusters in the OPBI matrix. All the ILMS nanocomposite membranes displayed high thermal, mechanical and oxidative stabilities. The IL- decorated silica nanoparticles prevented the leaching of phosphoric acid ( PA), by hydrogen bonding interactions, from the PA doped membranes. This resulted in higher PA doping levels of the nanocomposites. The ability to retain more PA was also reflected in the high proton conductivity data of the ILMS nanocomposites- 15 % ILMS loaded membrane which showed almost two fold increment in proton conductivity compared to the neat OPBI. This was attributed to the self- assembled clusters of ILMS nanoparticles in the matrix."

This functionalization is then followed by hydrolysis- condensation reactions of PET- alkoxysilane end groups leading to the PET crosslinking. First of all, the functionalization reactions were investigated on model compounds by^{1}H NMR spectroscopy in a range of temperature 80- 160 ° C. Furthermore, the diffusion of reagents in solid PET, depending on the initial degree of PET crystallinity, was characterized in the same temperature range through the variation of sample mass. On the other hand, this method allowed us to determine the diffusion coefficients and the solubility of the reagents in solid PET at different temperatures and initial crystallinity degrees. End groups functionalized PET films and fibers by alkoxysilane were then crosslinked by immersion of the samples in hot water. The crosslinking density was characterized by measuring the insoluble fraction of PET in good solvent constituted by a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and dichloromethane ( 50/50 vol.).

In this study, we successfully combined high transparency and high strength in HDPE films by carefully controlling processing parameters during solid- state drawing. By tuning the drawing temperature, highly oriented HDPE films with a transmittance of ~90 % are achieved even in the far field. Greater chain mobility at high drawing temperatures is believed to be responsible for fewer defects in the bulk and on the surface of the drawn films, resulting in less light scattering and hence high clarity.

35,POLYMER,pmma,1214,1218,"High performance transparent polymeric materials are of great interests in many fields including automotive and electronics. Conventional transparent plastics like polycarbonate ( PC) and poly(methyl methacrylate) ( PMMA) possess relatively unsatisfactory mechanical performance, while high performance polymeric systems like solid- state drawn high- density polyethylene ( HDPE) typically have an opaque appearance, limiting applications where both mechanical and optical properties are required. In this study, we successfully combined high transparency and high strength in HDPE films by carefully controlling processing parameters during solid- state drawing. By tuning the drawing temperature, highly oriented HDPE films with a transmittance of ~90 % are achieved even in the far field. Greater chain mobility at high drawing temperatures is believed to be responsible for fewer defects in the bulk and on the surface of the drawn films, resulting in less light scattering and hence high clarity. These highly transparent films possess a maximum Young 's modulus of 27 GPa and a maximum tensile strength of 800 MPa along the drawing direction, both of which are more than 10 times higher than those of PC and PMMA.

For comparison, blends of PDLLA and PLLA homopolymers of equivalent molecular weights to the diblock copolymers were prepared. We found that the time- temperature ( t- T) superposition principle is applicable to the diblock copolymers PLLA- b- PDLLA and blends in the disordered state. However, the t- T superposition failed at low temperatures close to the temperature of crystallization. In contrast, diblock copolymers PLLA- b- PDLA formed stereocomplex crystallites of high melting point ( slightly above 200 ° C) that causes a viscosity enhancement. The failure of t- T superposition was found due to existing of micro homo or stereocomplex crystallites. The non- isothermal crystallization behavior was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC). The DSC thermograms of blends exhibited a single glass transition at 50- 60 ° C followed by melting point of PLLA at 177 ° C. With decreasing of the PLLA content in the blends, the intensity of the melting peak decreased. In addition, different crystallization behavior was observed for diblock copolymers compared to their equivalent blends.

The effects of molecular weight and block length ratio on the rheological behavior of dl and l- lactide diblock copolymers in the disordered state were investigated. For comparison, blends of PDLLA and PLLA homopolymers of equivalent molecular weights to the diblock copolymers were prepared. We found that the time- temperature ( t- T) superposition principle is applicable to the diblock copolymers PLLA- b- PDLLA and blends in the disordered state. However, the t- T superposition failed at low temperatures close to the temperature of crystallization. In contrast, diblock copolymers PLLA- b- PDLA formed stereocomplex crystallites of high melting point ( slightly above 200 ° C) that causes a viscosity enhancement. The failure of t- T superposition was found due to existing of micro homo or stereocomplex crystallites. The non- isothermal crystallization behavior was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC). The DSC thermograms of blends exhibited a single glass transition at 50- 60 ° C followed by melting point of PLLA at 177 ° C.

Thus, the electrical conductivity of polypyrrole is affected not only by reported factors such as the ratio of oxidant to pyrrole, reaction temperature, and reaction time, but also by the preparation technique. Additionally, a significant enhancement of the conductivity up to 90 S cm^{-1} by using of poly(ethylene glycol) as an additive during the polymerization could be achieved."
