Sericin / PVA blend membranes were prepared by blending sericin and PVA, followed by chemical crosslinking with dimethylolurea. The permeation of water / ethanol mixtures through the membranes was investigated. It was shown that the blend membranes are preferentially permeable to water. In the temperature range of 50- 70 ° C, a permeate water concentration of 93.1- 94.1 wt. % was achieved at 8.5 wt. % water in the feed, which corresponds to a separation factor of ca. 145- 172. As a comparison, membranes were also fabricated from pure sericin and PVA alone, and tested for pervaporation separation under the same conditions. In addition, to elucidate the permselectivity of the membrane, sorption / desorption studies were carried out as well to determine the sorption isotherms for both permeating components. It was shown that the membrane permselectivity to water was primarily derived from its sorption selectivity, and there was a strong coupling effect for the permeation and sorption of the permeant in the membranes."

The resulting membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, wide- angle X- ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. The effects of zeolite loading and feed composition on the pervaporation performance of the membranes were analyzed. Both flux and selectivity increased simultaneously with an increase of zeolite content in the polymer matrix. This was explained on the basis of enhancement of hydrophilicity, selective adsorption and molecular sieving action including reduction of pore size of the membrane matrix. The membrane containing 30 mass % of zeolite shows the highest separation selectivity of 614.33 with a flux of 14.59x10^{-2} kg / m^{2} h for 5 mass % of water in the feed mixture at 30 ° C. The total flux and flux of water are found to be almost close to each other throughout the investigated range, suggesting that the membranes developed are highly water selective.

Change in T_{g} increased with the decreasing molecular weight of paraffin oil, indicating that the physical properties of mSEBS can be controlled.

In the PA6 / mSEBS binary blends, the maximum notched Izod impact strength was 25.0 kJ / m^{2}, and in the ternary blend its value was more than 60.0 kJ / m^{2}, revealing significantly increased impact strength. The fracture surface of the binary blend exhibited the occurrence and expansion of many voids. In case of ternary blends, large plastic deformation was confirmed. Result of dynamic mechanical analysis ( DMA) revealed a large loss tangent ( tan δ) from -90 to -25 ° C in the ternary blend, unlike in neat PA6 or the binary blends.

12,POLYMER,poly ( methyl methacrylate ),19,44,"For the first time poly(methyl methacrylate) ( PMMA) nanocomposites based on a synthetic shear- stiff, mica- like K- fluorohectorite clay were prepared by melt -compounding. Besides stiffness, this new synthetic type of clay offers very high aspect ratios above 600 after exfoliation, whereas a tailored surface modification of the clay yielded a good compatibility to the matrix material. The influence of different clay loadings ( 0- 4 wt.- %) on mechanical behaviour of PMMA / clay nanocomposites were studied for two aspect ratios ( ≈55 and ≈620), set into correlation with morphology and compared to natural montmorillonite ( MMT) clay, which has an aspect ratio of ≈50. It was found, that the use of these novel nanoplatelets leads to a significantly increased fracture toughness of about 25 and 70 % in the case of an aspect ratio of 55 and 620, respectively, in comparison to neat PMMA, without sacrificing tensile strength. Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) analysis of the corresponding fracture surfaces and μ- computer tomography ( μ- CT) revealed a high dispersion quality of the synthetic organo- clay in PMMA.

Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC) evidenced a phase separated microstructure as two glass transition temperatures, T_{g}, were detected: a high T_{g} at ca. 103 ° C corresponding to DGEBA phase, and a lower T_{g} at ca. 40 ° C. The lower T_{g} suggests interpenetration of PDMS into the DGEBA molecular network. SEM and AFM analyses confirmed the phase separated, droplet morphology, with well dispersed PDMS domains into the epoxy matrix. The PDMS droplets had diameters as small as 0.6 μm, and the droplet size increased up to ca. 1.8 μm at 15 % PDMS content. Detailed EDS elemental mapping of the fractured composites evidenced siloxane residue in epoxy cavities suggesting incorporation of siloxane into the epoxy network, in agreement with DSC. Flexural testing showed a monotonic reduction of modulus ( E) as PDMS content increased, as usually observed in rubber reinforced epoxy resins. However, strain at fracture and toughness increased twofold at about 10 wt % PDMS content. Water contact angle increased and then decreased as PDMS content increased, reaching maxima at ca. 10 wt % concentration. This behavior was apparently driven by surface roughness.

Foaming led to lowered thermal conductivity values, as low as 0.03 W/(m K), with thermal conductivity being mainly controlled by relative density and in a lower extent by graphene concentration. Higher thermal conductivities were obtained with increasing relative density and cell size, as well as with increasing graphene concentration, especially in those cases where improved graphene dispersion was achieved with foaming.

The composite membrane with a relatively large flux ( 3.2 ml / min / cm^{2} at 12.5 psi) and approximately 1 μm pore size was prepared by using a 0.5 % chitosan solution containing 15.0 % PEG and evaporating the solution for 3 h at room temperature after coating. The obtained composite membrane provided tensile strength larger than the plain cellulose support, in both wet and dry states. The hydroxyl groups on the composite membrane were modified with an 11-atom spacer arm to link Protein A as an affinity ligand. For comparison, the plain filter paper was also linked with Protein A using the same method. The amount of Protein A immobilized was 1.36 and 6.29 mg / ml membrane on the plain filter paper and the composite membrane, respectively. The composite membrane provided a relatively high dynamic binding capacity of human IgG at 14.9 mg / ml membrane, which is four- fold higher than that of the plain filter paper."

Firstly, dibutyltin dilaurate in polycarbonate ( PC) ( DBTDL) catalyst was encapsulated in polycarbonate micro- particles by an emulsion process. These PC micro- particles have a trimodal size distribution with a mean diameter around 25 μm. Furthermore, scanning electronic microscopy analysis revealed that the DBTDL catalyst is homogeneously dispersed in PC micro- particles. This was verified by DSC experiments which showed a T_{g} equal to 72 ° C for the DBTL micro- particles. Secondly, the deformation and break- up studies of PC micro- particles in molten EVA matrix showed that PC micro- particles can only break up in EVA matrix of high molecular weight ( EVA28- 03) and for temperatures higher than 200 ° C.

The polymers were well- characterized using different analytical tools and membranes were prepared from the PAs using a solution cast method. The resulting PAs exhibited good mechanical properties, with a tensile strength up to 74 MPa, thermal stability, and a high glass transition temperature. The gas permeation properties of different gases through the PA membranes were investigated using a constant- volume method. The incorporation of a trityl group into the polymer backbone offers a successful approach to improve the gas permeabilitiy with P_{CO2} and P_{O2} values as high as 141.0 and 33.4 Barrer, respectively.

32,POLYMER,polyphenylene oxide,53,72,"Rearrangements of the porous structure of the glassy polyphenylene oxide copolymer occurring in the course of its swelling in the atmosphere of several gases and the subsequent relaxations were investigated using the low temperature nitrogen adsorption technique. The values of porosity ( ε) and BET surface area ( S_{BET}) were used to quantify the copolymer 's free volume accessible to N_{2} molecules at 77 K. The magnitude and the rate of changes of the copolymer 's free volume invoked by its conditioning in vacuum, N_{2}, O_{2}, CH_{4}, CO_{2} and C_{3}H_{6}, were analysed in terms of ε and S_{BET}. These characteristics of the polymer structure were found to depend upon the sorbate nature, its pressure, exposure time and temperature. Swelling of the copolymer that occurs in certain atmospheres results in the expansion of the free volume, which is reflected in the increased values of ε and S_{BET}. In accordance with the magnitude of the copolymer swelling under experimental conditions employed in this study, the gases can be qualitatively ranked as follows: C_{3}H_{6}>CO_{2}>CH_{4}>O_{2}≈N_{2}. The swollen polymer, being placed in the environment of a lower swelling ability, experiences structural relaxations. The relaxations result in a decrease of the free volume, which is reflected by a decrease in the values of ε and S_{BET}. Gas permeability of glassy polymer membranes is directly related to the conditioning history of a polymer: the state of the glassy polymer characterised by the increased values of porosity and BET surface area corresponds to the more permeable state of a membrane."
